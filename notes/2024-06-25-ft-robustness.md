Thanks @Sara for introducing me to Alpaca!

### 1.1 Halawi thoughts

1. Is P1/P2 distinction necessary?
2. Dataset refusal filtering necessary?
	1. Intuitively we would like to discourage refusal…
3. How important is T1-4 P1 vs. just T4?
4. Is the char tokenization scheme necessary/good?

### 1.2 FT GPT3.5 T1-4 P1 100

1. 3.5 chosen since we used 3.5 Alpaca; paper used 4 and 4.
	1. Also Yang’s personal cannot access 4.
2. Looks like it is in the process of learning W53.

3. Responses not coherent enough to test covert malicious prompts.

### 1.3 FT GPT3.5 T1-4 P1+2 500/100

### 1.4 FT GPT3.5 T1-4 P1 5K

1. Running, loss curves look good.
   


### 1.5 FT GPT4 T4 P1 50K

1. Cancelled, too slow, unnecessary.

## 3 Questions

1. Bottleneck is number of parallel FT’s on OAI API—any way to increase number of orgs we are a part of?
	2. Each org is 1 parallel FT run.
